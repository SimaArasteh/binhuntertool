# binhuntertool

This is a implementation of paper *BinHunter: A Fine-Grained Graph Representation for Localizing Vulnerabilities in Binary Executables*.
BinHunter is a tool to find and localize different types of vulnerabilities inside binary programs. BinHunter leverages Graph convulutional Neural Network (GCN) to train vulnerabilities. For each type of vulnerability, we train a seperate classifier. In the training phase,
